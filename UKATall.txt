SN Used historically to refer to seamen of South Asian (mainly Indian)origin who worked as contracted employees on British trading vessels between the 17th and 20th centuries. Visram (1986) states that the term was commonly used in relation to seaman born within the territories of the East India Company and gives examples of its earlier origins in a footnote which suggests that "[Lascar] is a European adaptation from the Hindi and Persian word Lashkar, meaning an army, a camp or a band of followers. The early Portuguese used it to mean 'soldiers', and later it came to be applied to sailors."  (Source: Visram, Rozina (1986) Ayahs, Lascars and Princes: Indians in Britain, 1700-1947, London: Pluto Press, p.231).
